                                <p> Today was the first day at CourageousFuture Pvt Ltd. Our mentor tell us about all
                                    the content we will cover in this industrial training which is relevant for Cyber
                                    Security of IT companies and will also help to get experience how a real Cyber
                                    Security was&nbsp;implemented in&nbsp;the companies.</p>



                                <p>Today we leaned about the Cyber security is the most concerned matter as cyber
                                    threats and attacks are overgrowing.Attackers are now using more sophisticated
                                    techniques to target the systems. Individuals,small-scale businesses or large
                                    organizati on, are all being impacted. So, all these firms whether IT or non-IT
                                    firms have understood the importance of Cyber Security and focusing on adopting all
                                    possible measures to deal with cyber threats.</p>



                                <p><strong>What is cyber security?</strong><br>Cyber security is the protection of
                                    Internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data from cyber
                                    attacks.<br>It is made up of two words one is cyber and other is security.<br>
                                    Cyber is related to the technology which contains systems, network and programs or
                                    data.<br> Whereas security related to the protection which includes systems
                                    security, network security and application and information security.</p>



                                <p></p>



                                <p><strong>Why is cyber security important?</strong><br>Listed below are the reasons why
                                    cyber security is so important in what’s become a predominant digital world:<br>
                                    Cyber attacks can be extremely expensive for businesses to endure.<br> In addition
                                    to financial damage suffered by the business, a data breach can also inflict untold
                                    reputational damage.<br> Cyber-attacks these days are becoming progressively
                                    destructive. Cybercriminals are using more sophisticated ways to initiate cyber
                                    attacks.<br> Regulations such as GDPR are forcing organizations into taking better
                                    care of the personal data they hold.<br>Because of the above reasons, cyber security
                                    has become an important part of the business and the focus now is on developing
                                    appropriate response plans that minimize the damage in the event of a cyber attack
                                </p>



                                <p></p>



                                <p>Today we started the training journey with Cyber security fundamentals
                                    Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. These are the basic funda-mentals of
                                    the cyber security which include the preventing the unauthorized access to data.</p>



                                <p><strong>Cyber security Fundamentals – Confidentiality:</strong><br>Confidentiality is
                                    about preventing the disclosure of data to unauthorized parties.<br>It also means
                                    trying to keep the identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and holding
                                    data private and anonymous.<br>Often confidentiality is compromised by cracking
                                    poorly encrypted data, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, disclosing sensitive
                                    data.<br>Standard measures to establish confidentiality include:<br> Data
                                    encryption<br> Two-factor authentication<br> Biometric verification<br> Security
                                    tokens</p>

                                <p>Yesterday we started the training journey with Cyber security funda-mentals
                                    Confidentiality. Today we understand the integrity means to protect the data from
                                    any type of modification of the data. </p>



                                <p><strong>Integrity</strong><br>Integrity refers to protecting information from being
                                    modified by unauthorized parties.<br>Standard measures to guarantee integrity
                                    include:<br> Cryptographic checksums<br> Using file permissions<br> Uninterrupted
                                    power supplies<br> Data backups</p>



                                <p></p>



                                <p>Yesterday we started the training journey with Cyber security funda-mentals
                                    Integrity. Today we understand the availability means to only the authorized can
                                    access the data.</p>



                                <p><strong>Availability</strong><br>Availability is making sure that authorized parties
                                    are able to access the information when needed.<br>Standard measures to guarantee
                                    availability include:<br> Backing up data to external drives<br> Implementing
                                    firewalls<br> Having backup power supplies<br> Data redundancy</p>



                                <p></p>



                                <p>Today we understand the types of the cyber attacks which is mostly classified into
                                    the two types web-based and system-based. We started with the Web-based attacks like
                                    sql injection, DNS spoofing etc.</p>



                                <p><strong>Types of Cyber Attacks</strong><br>A cyber-attack is an exploitation of
                                    computer systems and networks. It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic
                                    or data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity
                                    theft.<br>Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories:<br>1)
                                    Web-based attacks <br>2) System-based attacks<br>Web-based attacks<br>These are the
                                    attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of the important
                                    web-based attacks are as follows</p>



                                <p><strong>1. Injection attacks</strong><br>It is the attack in which some data will be
                                    injected into a web application to manipulate the application and fetch the required
                                    information.<br>Example- SQL Injection, code Injection, log Injection, XML Injection
                                    etc.</p>



                                <p><strong>2. DNS Spoofing</strong><br>DNS Spoofing is a type of computer security
                                    hacking. Whereby a data is introduced into a DNS resolver’s cache causing the name
                                    server to return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to the attackers
                                    computer or any other computer. The DNS spoofing attacks can go on for a long period
                                    of time without being detected and can cause serious security issues.</p>

                                <p></p>



                                <p>Yesterday we understand the types of the cyber attacks which is mostly classified
                                    into the two types web-based and system-based. Today started with the Web-based
                                    attacks like Pishing, session hijacking , brute force etc.</p>



                                <ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
                                    <li><strong>Session Hijacking</strong><br>It is a security attack on a user session
                                        over a protected network. Web applications create cookies to store the state and
                                        user sessions. By stealing the cookies, an attacker can have access to all of
                                        the user data.</li>



                                    <li><strong>Phishing</strong><br>Phishing is a type of attack which attempts to
                                        steal sensitive information like user login credentials and credit card number.
                                        It occurs when an attacker is masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic
                                        communication.</li>



                                    <li><strong>Brute force</strong><br>It is a type of attack which uses a trial and
                                        error method. This attack generates a large number of guesses and validates them
                                        to obtain actual data like user password and personal identification number.
                                        This attack may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by<br>security,
                                        analysts to test an organization’s network security.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Denial of Service</strong><br>It is an attack which meant to make a
                                        server or network resource unavailable to the users. It accomplishes this by
                                        flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a
                                        crash. It uses the single system and single internet connection to attack a
                                        server. It can be classified into the following Volume-based attacks- Its goal
                                        is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and is measured in bit per
                                        second.<br>Protocol attacks- It consumes actual server resources, and is
                                        measured in a packet.<br>Application layer attacks- Its goal is to crash the web
                                        server and is measured in request per second.</li>



                                    <li><strong>Dictionary attacks</strong><br>This type of attack stored the list of a
                                        commonly used password and validated them to get original password.</li>



                                    <li><strong>URL Interpretation</strong><br>It is a type of attack where we can
                                        change the certain parts of a URL, and one can make a web server to deliver web
                                        pages for which he is not authorized to browse.</li>

                                <p>Today we started the system-based attacks like Virus, worms , trojan horse, bots, etc
                                    these attacks are mostly linked with the personal computer or laptop. Like the virus
                                    is most common attack in any system by which system can be slow down or even in
                                    worst case the system can also crash.</p>



                                <p><strong>System-based attacks</strong><br>These are the attacks which are intended to
                                    compromise a computer or a computer network. Some of the important system-based
                                    attacks are as follows – </p>



                                <p><strong>1. Virus</strong><br>It is a type of malicious software program that spread
                                    throughout the computer files without the knowledge of a user. It is a
                                    self-replicating malicious computer program that replicates by inserting copies of
                                    itself into other computer programs when executed. It can also execute instructions
                                    that cause harm to the system.</p>



                                <p><strong>2. Worm</strong><br>It is a type of malware whose primary function is to
                                    replicate itself to spread to uninfected computers. It works same as the computer
                                    virus. Worms often originate from email attachments that appear to be from trusted
                                    senders.</p>



                                <p><strong>3. Trojan horse</strong><br>It is a malicious program that occurs unexpected
                                    changes to computer setting and unusual activity, even when the computer should be
                                    idle. It misleads the user of its true intent. It appears to be a normal application
                                    but when opened/executed some malicious code will run in the background.</p>



                                <p><strong>4. Backdoors</strong><br>It is a method that bypasses the normal
                                    authentication process. A developer may create a backdoor so that an application or
                                    operating system can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes.</p>



                                <p><strong>5. Bots</strong><br>A bot (short for “robot”) is an automated process that
                                    interacts with other network services. Some bots program run automatically, while
                                    others only execute commands when they receive specific input. Common examples of
                                    bots program are the crawler, chatroom bots,<br>and malicious bots.</p>

                                <p>Cyber threats are security incidents or circumstances with the potential to have a
                                    negative outcome for your network or other data management systems.<br>Examples of
                                    common types of security threats include phishing attacks that result in the
                                    installation of malware that infects your data, failure of a staff member to follow
                                    data protection protocols that cause a data breach, or even a tornado that takes
                                    down your company’s data headquarters, disrupting access.<br>Vulnerabilities are the
                                    gaps or weaknesses in a system that make threats possible and tempt threat actors to
                                    exploit them.<br>Types of vulnerabilities in network security include but are not
                                    limited to SQL injections, server misconfigurations, cross-site scripting, and
                                    transmitting sensitive data in a nonencrypted plain text format.<br>When threat
                                    probability is multiplied by the potential loss that may result, cyber security
                                    experts, refer to this as a risk.</p>



                                <p><strong>SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, THREATS AND ATTACKS </strong>–<br>Categories of
                                    vulnerabilities<br> Corrupted (Loss of integrity)<br> Leaky (Loss of
                                    confidentiality)<br> Unavailable or very slow (Loss of availability)<br>– Threats
                                    represent potential security harm to an asset when vulnerabilities are exploited</p>



                                <p> –Attacks are threats that have been carried out<br> Passive – Make use of
                                    information from the system without affecting system resources<br> Active – Alter
                                    system resources or affect operation<br> Insider – Initiated by an entity inside
                                    the organization<br> Outsider – Initiated from outside the perimeter</p>



                                <p><strong>Computer criminals</strong><br>Computer criminals have access to enormous
                                    amounts of hardware, software, and data; they have the potential to cripple much of
                                    effective business and government throughout the world. In a sense, the purpose of
                                    computer security is to prevent these criminals from doing damage.<br>We say
                                    computer crime is any crime involving a computer or aided by the use of one.
                                    Although this definition is admittedly broad, it allows us to consider ways to
                                    protect ourselves, our businesses, and our communities against those who use
                                    computers maliciously.<br>One approach to prevention or moderation is to understand
                                    who commits these crimes and why. Many studies have attempted to determine the
                                    characteristics of computer criminals. By studying those who have already used
